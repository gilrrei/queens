class ControlVariatesIterator(Iterator):
    r"""Monte Carlo control variates iterator.

    The control variates method in the context of Monte Carlo is used to quantify uncertainty in a
    model when input parameters are uncertain and only expressed as probability distributions. The
    Monte Carlo control variates method uses so-called low-fidelity models as control variates to
    make the quantification more precise. In the context of Monte Carlo, the control variate method
    is sometimes also called control variable method.

    The estimator for the Monte Carlo control variates method with a single control variate is
    given by
    :math:`\hat{\mu}_{f}= \underbrace{\frac{1}{N} \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N} \Big [ f(x^{(i)}) - \alpha
    \Big(g(x^{(i)}) - \hat\mu_{g} \Big) \Big]}_\textrm{cross-model estimator}`
    where :math:`f` represents the model, :math:`g` the control variate, and :math:`\hat\mu_{g}`
    the expectation of the control variate. :math:`N` represents the number of samples on the
    cross-model estimator and :math:`x^{(i)}` are random parameter samples.

    In case the mean of the control variate is known, :math:`\hat\mu_{g}` can be passed to the
    iterator as expectation_cv. Otherwise, :math:`\hat\mu_{g}` is estimated with the Monte
    Carlo method.

    The implementation is based on chapter 9.3 in [1] and uses one control variate.
