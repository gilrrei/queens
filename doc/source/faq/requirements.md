# What are the requirements for QUEENS?

Currently, QUEENS is only tested on UNIX systems. Besides Python, QUEENS requires [rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/) in order to copy simulation files.

The Python dependencies for QUEENS can be found in the `requirements.txt` file. There are a lot of them and we are working on reducing them, or at least making them optional.
